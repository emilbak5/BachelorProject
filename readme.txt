This repository contains all of the code that has been used in my bachelors thesis. To run the code write the path of the folder for the model must be know. If for example the placement of the folder are on the desktop, the following lines in the terminal will run the program.

```
python3 detect_picamera.py  --model /home/pi/Desktop/model_files/coral_model.tflite  --labels /home/pi/Desktop/model_files/coco_labels.txt
```
